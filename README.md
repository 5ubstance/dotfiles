# All hail the .dotfiles

This repo contains a few of my dotfiles and is an attempt at making it easier to reproduce my current setup on another machine.

## Contents

It currently contains :

 - My zsh config (.zshrc and .oh-my-zsh folder)
 - My tmux config (.tmux.conf)
 - My vim config (.vimrc and .vim folder)
 - My git config (.gitconfig)

## Disclaimer

This collection of files is pretty much a code collage from a number of sources. I'm not gonna attempt to list them all here but a few notable entries are :

 - [Base16's Monokai Dark iterm theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2/blob/master/base16-monokai.dark.256.itermcolors)
 - [Molokai for Vim](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai)
 - [Smyck terminal color theme](http://color.smyck.org/)
 - [My zsh theme is mostly based off of alanpeabody's](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/alanpeabody.zsh-theme)

However, if you feel you deserve credit for any part of these files, just let me know and I'll credit you right here.

Also, I can't be held responsible if your computer bursts into flames or eats your firstborn after using these files. You never know.
